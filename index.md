# Mapping Dark Matter via Gravitational Lensing

We are an inter-disciplinary research group at the Department of ICT and 
Natural Sciences at NTNU in Ã…lesund, working on gravitational lensing.

+ [Professor Hans Georg Schaathun](http://www.hg.schaathun.net/)
  is a computer scientist working on simulation and machine learning
+ [Dr Ben David Normann](https://www.bendavidnormann.com/research)
  is a mathematical physicist working on cosmology

These pages present software prototypes which we have made publicly available.
