## The Simulation Model

Critical functions
+ `eta` is the actual source position, and is returned by `getEta()`
+ `updateApparentAbs)` does several things
    + It samples $\psi$, calling `lens->updatePsi(im.size())`
    + It sets the apparent position $\nu$, by first geting $\xi$
      from the lens by calling `getXi($\chi\eta$)`.


# Terminology

+ `eta` ($\eta$) is the actual position of the source in the source plane.
    + This is set by `SimulatorModel::setXY` or `SimulatorModel::setPolar`
    + RaytraceModel uses a local $\eta$ corresponding to the pixel currently
      being evaluated, but this is local to that single method.
+ `nu` ($\nu$) is the apparent position of the source in the source plane.
    + This can be set with `SimulatorModel::setNu`.
+ `xi` ($\xi$) is the apparent position of the image in the lens plane.
    + This is updated by `SimulatorModel::setNu`, as $\xi=\chi\nu$.
    + RouletteModel also has a `setXi()` method to set $\xi$ to an arbitrary
      position.
+ `etaOffset` ($\Delta\eta$) is so that $\xi$ is the image
  $\eta+\Delta\eta$.



# TODO

+ `getDistortedPos(r,theta)` calculates the source plane position $\eta'$
  in the local co-ordinate system centred at `eta`, given a polar
  co-ordinates $(r,\theta)$ centred on `\xi` in the lens plane.
    + this is called in `SimulatorModel::distort()`
    + `etaOffset` is added to the output to compensate if $\xi$ is not
      the apparent position
+ RaytraceModel has its own `distort()` function not using
  `getDistortedPos(r,theta)` working on a different logic

# Technical Design

## Components

### C++ components

+ Simulation Models
    + `SimulatorModel.cpp` is the abstract base class.
    + Modular Lens Models
        + `RouletteModel.cpp`
        + `Raytrace.cpp`
    + Semi-Modular Models using `RotatedModel.cpp` as a superclass.
      It overrides functions to rotate the image and make all calculations
      assuming the source placed on the $x$-axis.
      The subclasses override `getDistortedPos()` to hardcode the actual
      distortion, and thus assume a specific lens model, but they still
      delegate `getXi()` to a Lens Object.
        + `PointMassExact.cpp` simulates the point mass model
          using the exact formulation
        + `PointMassRoulette.cpp` simulates the point mass model using
          the Roulette formalism
    + Monolithic Lens/Simulation Models
	+ `RouletteRegenerator.cpp` is for simulation from roulette amplitudes
	   without any concrete lens model.
+ Lens Models
    + `SIS.cpp` 
    + `SIE.cpp`  
    + `PointMass.cpp` is incomplete and so far used only with the `RotateModel` models. 
+ Source Models
    + `Source.cpp` is the abstract base class.
    + `SphericalSource.cpp` is standard Guassian model
    + `EllipsoidSource.cpp` is an ellipsoid Guassian model
    + `TriangleSource.cpp` is a three colour triangle source,
       intended for debugging
+ `simaux.cpp` is auxiliary functions
+ `CosmoSim.cpp` defines the `CosmoSimPy` class with python bindigs.
  This class operates as a facade to the library, and does not 
  expose the individual classes.

### Python Components

+ `CosmoSim` is a wrapper around `CosmoSimPy` from `CosmoSim.cpp`,
  defining the `CosmoSim` class.
+ `CosmoGUI` is a tkinter desktop application, providing a GUI to the
  simulator
+ `CosmoSim.View` is a tkinter widget displaying the source and 
  distorted image for `CosmoGUI`.
+ `CosmoSim.Controller` is a tkinter widget to interactively set
  the simulator parameters for `CosmoGUI`.
+ `CosmoSim.Image` provides post-processing functions for the images.
+ `datagen.py` is a batch script to generate distorted images.


## Simulator Model Class

### Virtual Functions

The following virtual functions have to be overridden by most subclasses.
They are called from the main update function and overriding them, the entire
lens model changes.

+ `calculateAlphaBeta()`
  pre-calculates $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the distortion equation.
+ `getDistortedPos()`
  calculates the distortion equation for a give pixel.

The constructor typically has to be overridden as well, to load the formul√¶ for
$\alpha$ and $\beta$.

### Setters 

Setters are provided for all of the control parameters.

+ `updateXY` to update the $(x,y)$ co-ordinates of the actual image, the
  relative distance $\chi$ to the lens compared to the source, and the
  Einstein radius $R_E$.
  This has to update the apparent position which depends on all of these
  variables.
+ `updateSize` to update the size or standard deviation of the source.
+ `updateNterms` to update the number of terms in the sum after truncation
+ `updateAll` to update all of the above

### Getters

Getters are provided for the three images.

+ `getActual()`
+ `getApparent()`
+ `getDistorted()`

### Update

The main routine of the `Simulator` is `update()` which recalculates the 
three images: actual, apparent, and distorted.  This is called by the setters.

In addition to the virtual functions mentioned above, it depends on

+ `parallelDistort()` and `distort()` which runs the main steps in parallel.
+ `drawParallel()` and `drawSource()` which draws the source image.
