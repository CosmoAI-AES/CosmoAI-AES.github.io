# Testing the Roulette Model 

+ **Purpose** test that the roulette model reasonably matches the raytrace model
+ **Directory** `Test/roulette`
+ **Date** created 24 May 2024

There are two scripts, one for SIE and one for SIS, that can be run
out of the box.
```sh
sh sie.sh
sh sis.sh
```

The results are shown in the `montageSIS` resp. `montageSIE` directory.

**TODO** This should be merged with the new 
[Model Comparison](Model Comparison) tests.
