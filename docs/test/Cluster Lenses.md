# Tests of Cluster Lenses

+ **Directory** Tests/Cluster
+ **Purpose** test the new cluster lens models

```
cd Tests/Cluster
sh make.sh
```

This creates the montage directory (among others) comparing
singleton clusters with equivalent individual lenses.

```
cd Tests/Cluster
sh cluster.sh
```

This creates a few samples of clusters in the Cluster directory
as examples.  It is not yet clear how to evaluate these
